# üõ°Ô∏è Entropy-Based DDoS Detection Simulation Platform

A full-stack simulation platform for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using entropy-based statistical analysis. Built with React, Node.js, Express, and Chart.js, this project visualizes detection metrics in real time and demonstrates how entropy can identify anomalous traffic patterns.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This platform simulates network traffic and applies entropy-based detection to identify potential DDoS attacks. It computes key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and presents them through interactive charts.

- **Frontend**: React + Chart.js
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Detection Method**: Shannon Entropy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

---

## üß† Key Concepts

- **Entropy**: Measures randomness in packet source distribution. Low entropy indicates repetitive sources, often a sign of DDoS.
- **Window-Based Analysis**: Traffic is grouped into windows; entropy is calculated per window.
- **Thresholding**: If entropy < threshold, the window is flagged as an attack.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ddos-entropy-simulator.git
cd ddos-entropy-simulator
npm install

Running the App
Start the backend:

bash
node server.js
Start the frontend:

bash
cd client
npm start

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can configure simulation parameters via the frontend UI:

Window Size: Number of packets per analysis window

Attack Probability: Likelihood of malicious packets

Entropy Threshold: Detection sensitivity

üìä Simulation Flow
Traffic Generation: Simulates packets with varying source IPs.

Entropy Calculation: Shannon entropy is computed for each window.

Detection: If entropy < threshold, window is flagged.

Metric Evaluation: Confusion matrix is updated.

Visualization: Charts display entropy trends and detection metrics.

üìà Example
text
Window Size: 1000 packets
Attack Probability: 0.9
Entropy Threshold: 0.95

‚Üí Most packets come from a single IP ‚Üí Low entropy
‚Üí System flags window as attack
‚Üí Metrics updated and visualized
